"Optimization approaches plugin
In many business applications, prediction is only the starting point. For instance, if we have a model that predicts stocks in different warehouses, we still need to see how to best optimize the transport between the warehouses. 
This plugin provides a template notebook that shows how to optimize tranport in a network using linear programming with Pyomo."
